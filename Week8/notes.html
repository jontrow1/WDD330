    <h2>Week 8 Notes</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 8:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
      <li>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top</li>
      <li>Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10. To make the aforementioned code work in IE9 and older mobile WebKit browsers, you would include the following:

        -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 
        ↵4.4.3, BB10 */
        -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
        transform: translate(45px,-45px);</li>
      <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. </li>
      <li>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to our span</li>
      <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.</li>
      <li>A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other words, the element’s center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change. </li>
      <li>Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform : because of the cascade, a second transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions.</li>
      <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. </li>
      <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. </li>
      <li>As with translate and scale , there are axis-specific versions of the skew transform: skewX() and skewY()</li>
      <li>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. </li>
      <li>While CSS3 transforms are unsupported in IE before version 9, you can mimic these effects with other CSS properties, including filters</li>
      <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. </li>
      <li>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:

        Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.
        
        Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.
        
        Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
      <li>The -webkit- vendor prefix is still needed for older mobile devices, including iOS6.1, BlackBerry10, Android 4.3 and UC Browser for Android.</li>
      <li>The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</li>
      <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.</li>
      <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. </li>
      <li>The most common timing functions include the key terms ease , linear , ease-in , ease-out , or ease-in-out . </li>
      <li>Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, a negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start partway through the animation. </li>
      <li>Shorthand: transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</li>
      <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
      <li>Akeyframeis a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition.</li>
      <li>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block.</li>
      <li>The animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%):</li>
      <li>While animation-name is the only required animation property to create an animation, the animation-duration shouldbe considered required to animate an element.</li>
      <li>Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration.</li>
      <li>The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through. </li>
      <li>The animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation:</li>
      <li>The animation-fill-mode property defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes.</li>
      <li>If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name . You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards , running , or alternate .</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Chapter 12:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.</li>
      <li>The first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page:</li>
      <li>All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.</li>
      <li>In the HTML5 canvas, you must do the same, and we do so with the strokeStyle or fillStyle properties. Both strokeStyle and fillStyle are set on a context object, and both take one of three values: a string representing a color, a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object.</li>
      <li>Instead of a color as our fillStyle , we could have used a CanvasGradient or a CanvasPattern object.</li>
      <li>Anonymous functions are much like regular functions except, as you might guess, they are without names.</li>
      <li>To create a CanvasGradient , we call one of two methods: createLinearGradient() or createRadialGradient() ; then we add one or more color stops to the gradient.</li>
      <li>We’re not limited to drawing rectangles—we can draw any shape we can imagine! Unlike rectangles and squares, however, there’s no built-in method for drawing circles or other shapes. To draw more interesting shapes, we must first lay out the path of the shape.</li>
      <li>Pathscreate a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a stroke!</li>
      <li>Radians are a unit used to measure angles, and the symbol π denotes a measurement in radians. One radian is equal to 180 degrees. Two radians, or 2π, are equal to 360 degrees.</li>
      <li>If we create an image programmatically using the Canvas API, but decide we’d like to have a local copy of our drawing, we can use the API’s toDataURL method to save our drawing.</li>
      <li>We can also draw images onto the canvas element. </li>
      <li>The getImageData method allows us to examine a small section of a canvas , so let’s use this feature to become more familiar with the data array. </li>
      <li>Creating the pixelData variable, which is then used several times in the for loop, saves us several property lookups.</li>
      <li>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers. </li>
      <li>Note that draggable isnota Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true .</li>
