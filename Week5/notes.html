    <h2>Week 5 Notes</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 10:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
        <li>An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</li>
        <li>For this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly.</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</li>
        <li>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: 'use strict';</li>
        <li>You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function</li>
        <li>In fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function</li>
        <li>Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.</li>
        <li>Modernizris a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection andCan I Use?is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.</li>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
        <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code.</li>
        <li>Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging.</li>
        <li>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.</li>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function</li>
        <li>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.</li>
        <li>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message.</li>
        <li>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.</li>
        <li>A finally block can be added after a catch block. This will always be executed after the try or catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is useful if you want some code to run in both cases.</li>
        <li>A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should.</li>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.</li>
        <li>Write tests (that initially fail), 
          Write code to pass the tests
          Refactor the code
          Test refactored code
          Write more tests for new features</li>
        <li>Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently.</li>
